# Two special focus tango classes and another great Homewood milonga.

## Saturday, March 24th, in Asheville.

## At [Homewood](http://www.mybelovedhomewood.com/ "The Homewood website."), 19 Zillicoa, Asheville, NC. [Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=190+zillicoa,+asheville,+nc&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x88598b4e1cf9b8eb:0x8eefb5e16d5df521,190+Zillicoa+St,+Asheville,+NC+28801&gl=us&ei=k5XbTuHlI42Wtwevwsj2CA&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CB0Q8gEwAA "Map to Homewood")

Here is a more comprehensive class that starts in the hips and sacrum and moves up the spine in a full exploration of how our bodies move.  We will provide visualizations and exercises that will have everyone creating holistic movement that can be used in everyday life and tango.

## These are the basic concepts that will allow anyone to see and use a plethora of turns and many other movements.

Building on the ideas of the first class, we will explore how to make our circular movement natural and fluid while we learn to visualize and use the axis of movement in each step. These are the basic concepts that will allow anyone to see and use a plethora of turns and many other movements.

## TANGO CLASSES

**Finding and using natural movement in your dance. ** 1-2:30 PM.
  
Relaxing into natural and healthy movement is one of the keys to a comfortable and fluid dance. We will help you explore and discover your natural movement and how it applies to tango. This class will help everyone be more connected to their partner and the ground in a more relaxed way.

**A multitude of turns: Using and moving the axis of movement. ** 3-4:30 PM.
  
Understanding the axis of movement is a key concept to understanding all turns and most other movements in tango. This class will explore circular movement and the many choices created when we are able to see and use the axis of movement in every step.

**HOMEWOOD MILONGA 8:00 PM to 1:00 AM**

Lisa Jacobs will be our DJ.

**Acupressure and Tui Na (Chinese massage) by Katie Bruce L.AC.
