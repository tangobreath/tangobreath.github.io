# To teach well is to question thoroughly

Yesterday, a lovely and inspiring woman, Sasha Cagen, from the San
Francisco area wrote us, inquiring about our ways of teaching tango
movement after having attended TangoBreath when she visited Asheville
this summer.  I was perplexed at first about how to respond. 
Explaining how to teach is a giant step from actually teaching.  There
are so many subtle ways in which our teaching, and learning, has evolved
in TangoBreath, from a word we might use to a way in which we physically
adjust people.  And there is so much, still, for us to learn.


In responding, I did realize one thing: to teach is to question. 
To teach well is to question thoroughly, and come to one’s own
understanding and value of a subject.  To teach best is to enable your
students to ask questions, to come to their own understanding, to be
their own teachers. Learning to question is at the heart of it all,
and learning to question may be the hardest thing to learn.

In the beginning of developing TangoBreath, We spent a ton of
time going over our TangoBreath movements with a fine toothed comb. 
We asked a lot of questions. We tried to get to the root of why we use
certain techniques, and the impact it has eventually on the dance, with
a partner.  Most of the descriptions we use have gone through a heavy
filtering process. That process allowed us to come to an even deeper
understanding of how and why we use certain techniques in the dance. In
turn, our own dancing improved remarkably.

## Evaluate instruction for clarity and a direct connection to posture and movement.

One thing that we did, and I would encourage everyone to do, is to write
down every “technique” or visualization you ever learned from a
teacher (or if you were like us, you probably already have them written
down).  Evaluate each of these for clarity and a direct connection to
posture and movement.  Some will be vague or disconnected from what
actually happens in your body, but they may lead to more precise ideas.

For us, the first thing that we eliminated from our vocabulary was
&#8220;grounding&#8221; or &#8220;ground yourself&#8221;.   It has too
much meaning, and to be fully sure that someone is on the same page,
it would require at least an hour of explanation, practice, and dialogue.

## Are descriptions of movement the principle thing that is allowing you to move correctly, or are they a _symptom?_

On the other hand, getting rid of those words made us think more precisely
about what does happen when someone &#8220;grounds&#8221;.  Descriptions
of those individual components are part of what we teach in
TangoBreath.   &#8220;Collection&#8221; and &#8220;lead from the
chest&#8221; are two other terms that we threw out completely.  We feel
that in most cases, from our observations of beginning tango students,
those descriptions create ideas which are harmful to a student&#8217;s
posture and movement.

Examining your original list will give you a different list of ideas and
techniques. Take those, and while moving either linearly or circularly,
try to isolate those techniques. The challenge is to find out how they
fit into the overall movement of the body. Are they the principle thing
that is allowing you to move correctly, or are they a _symptom_ (leading
from the chest, grounding, loose leg, collecting) of something else that
is happening in your body?  Is the technique described in the way that
it looks from the outside, or the way that it actually feels?

## Instruction that has been given to us in the past hasn’t necessarily been wrong, but it has been misleading.

Some examples of questions we asked ourselves, based on common
descriptions, were: Do our legs really start at our ribcage?  How
does &#8220;grounding&#8221; work?  Does our standing leg only
engage when we train it to, or is there something else that we do in
our bodies that causes it to engage automatically?  Is the “loose
leg” really loose?  What is a loose leg and what causes it?  Where
is our &#8220;tango core&#8221; and is that a good term?  What does it
mean to have &#8220;presence&#8221; or &#8220;forward intention&#8221;
or &#8220;to fill your back&#8221;?

We have found that a lot of the instruction that has been given
to us in the past hasn’t necessarily been wrong, but it has been
misleading. The only way we came to that understanding was to ask why
and to deeply explore the origins of movement in our body. Of course,
some of the instruction we have received has been spot on, but we only
started to understand it once we began asking questions.

We also referenced other sources for better understanding of movement. If
this is something you are interested in, we suggest Eric Franklin&#8217;s
book,  _Dynamic Movement Through Imagery_. (Thank you to our friend,
Deborah Iole, for introducing us to Eric Franklin!)

## Principles that guide us in the way we conceptualize movement

To give our exploration a framework, we also identified some principles
that guide us in the way we conceptualize movement, identify technique,
and describe how we use our bodies. We ask three questions when we are
repeating movements or working on the dance.  These are particularly
useful because we can both observe them and feel them:

  1. Is movement that is happening in my body connected to my center of
  gravity/core? For example, if we are moving our leg around in circles
  and using our outer hip, leg, and gluteus muscles only, we aren’t
  doing it right.  We should be able to feel that there is movement in
  our pelvis that is the source of all other movement.

  2. Is there dynamic tension or pressure in this movement/stance? We
  should always seek to align ourselves in a way that builds and releases
  energy.  This means that our posture has to be correct and stretched
  so that every joint and muscle are connected and our body can be
  responsive.  A slack guitar string doesn’t make a nice sound,
  or any sound.

  3. Lastly, and probably most importantly, where does the movement
  feel/become natural and healthy for our bodies?  We don’t mind
  “pain” when we are correcting our posture and our back muscles get
  sore because they aren’t used to being engaged.  But we never want
  to contort our bodies.  Having an awareness that we might think we
  are doing something correctly, but in fact, are not, helps us observe
  our bodies from different angles and eventually find the place where
  it &#8220;feels&#8221; right and moves in harmony.

Associated with the last principle, one of our priorities is to always
guide movement in a way that protects vulnerable joints, mainly the
knees and the lower back or sacrum.  As students of the dance, we can
be aware of this as well, taking responsibility for our health.  Hips
should always be square to the knees/direction of movement, or else you
can really run the risk of twisting and injuring them.

With the lower back, it’s important to make sure that you aren’t
thrusting your hips forward, or sticking your derriere out.  I ask
students to put their hands right where their hips meet the top of their
thighs, and ask them to rotate their pelvis forward slightly (like you are
sticking your tailbone up a little bit).  I then ask them to pull their
coccyx toward the center of their bodies, imagining that it is releasing
toward the floor. The first tilt makes the lower back feel slightly
compressed, and the second tilt brings the top of the pelvis back into
alignment above the bottom of the pelvis &#8212; this allows a natural
curvature of the spine, but makes you engage your lower abdominals and
pelvic floor,  bringing your posture upright again.  I feel that this,
along with lifting from the diaphragm, to elongate your torso and spine,
are the most distilled and important parts of achieving correct posture.

## The best thing that any of us who are students of tango can do is to become our own teachers

We have come to believe, through our own journey, that if you
are going to teach movement, the best thing is to come to your own
way of explaining it, from your heart and your physical knowledge,
rather than relying on regurgitated descriptions. The same is true for
learning. The best thing that any of us who are students of tango can do
is to become our own teachers, keeping an open heart and an open mind,
while we question, observe, and question again.
