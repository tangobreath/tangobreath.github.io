Due to a rather stressful summer it has been a few months since we have posted anything on our website. Thankfully life is beginning to return to normal whatever that is. It at least does not involve a hostile work environment!Â 

I wrote this article at the beginning of the summer at a time when these thoughts carried a great deal of emotion as well as meaning. Months later this article still rings true for me.

Our life experience effects our tango, and our tango effects our life.
