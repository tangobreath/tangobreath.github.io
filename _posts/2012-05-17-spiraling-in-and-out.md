Most of the time when we think of our spiral energy as it relates to
tango, we consider the torsion that happens in our torso, as our hips
and ribs twist in opposite directions. However, there are many other
&#8220;spirals&#8221; that happen in our bodies, and we would like
to draw attention to the spiral that happens in our legs as we take a
step.  Understanding how the leg articulates at the hip joint during
our walk can also transform our dance.

# Finding the spiral in our legs

solidly on your left foot, extend your right leg into a back
reach. Following the normal trajectory of your forward walk, bring
your right leg back to your center, closing your hips and allowing
your leg to rotate inward as it comes through your center line. You
will notice that your knees come together at this point. As your leg
extends in front of you, allow it to rotate outward. Take your right
leg back again, reversing the rotation in your leg, from outward, to an
inward rotation as you pass center, to a (slightly) outward rotation
as you reach back. While your foot will be moving in a straight line,
you may notice that your knee tracing an arc that sweeps past your other
knee. Repeat this motion a few times and then switch legs.

You may want to exaggerate this rotation of your legs to get the feel of
this spiral, and also to understand how it can influence your circular
movement, and then let it happen naturally without over emphasizing it. As
you do so, make sure you are still drawing a straight line forward and
back, without actually taking your leg out to the side.

Now, incorporate this awareness into your walk as you go about your
day.  When you have the time to slow down, walk deliberately, trying
to make your leg spiral smooth and expressive.
