From the _&#8220;ministry of silly walks&#8221;_,  this week&#8217;s challenge is a different way of thinking while walking.   As you are walking somewhere,  think about pushing off into each step rather than arriving in each step.  Think about launching instead of landing.  You may want to try it the other way around to see the difference, but primarily focus on pushing off, and let your steps land where they need to.  Explore how it feels and try different things at the same time to make your walk smooth.
