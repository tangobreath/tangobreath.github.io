# Eric and Susannah of TangoBreath are excited to announce a new immersive beginning tango class!

# This is the perfect opportunity to **dive into this dance** if you have been curious. And this is the class for you if you have been wanting to have **an intense, working review** of the heart of this dance &#8212; **core movement, good posture, and refined body awareness**!

This 4-hour class would cover** essential technique** in Argentine tango to prepare you to attend milongas (social dances) and practicas in a much shorter time than a more traditional series. We will also be inviting experienced dancers in our community to participate, so that you will have the opportunity to work with individuals who can give you personalized and knowledgeable feedback during the class.

## Sunday, August 26th

## 1:00 PM &#8211; 5:00 PM

## The West Asheville Vineyard, 717 Haywood Road

## $40.00 pre-registration
  
DEADLINE FOR REGISTERING: Friday, August 17th

We need to have a minimum number of participants to offer this class, so we encourage you to pre-register or contact us soon, if you are interested!

**Additional IMPORTANT information:**

We structure our classes in unique ways in order to delve into deep studies and explorations of our bodies and the material. Since we want you to get the best experience and assimilate the most from this intense class, we will have some required exercises and material before the lesson. We will provide all of this material to you two weeks in advance.
