# Argentine Tango classes for beginning and advanced dancers,
  
Every Wednesday in Asheville!

Followed by a 2 hour practica.

## **Join us this Wednesday, for another tangoBreath and tangolab.**

Check out our **new** article on [Forward head posture](http://tangobreath.com/forward-head-posture-and-argentine-tango/).
  
Last week&#8217;s body awareness challenge is [&#8220;Perceiving the dynamic sacrum&#8221;](http://tangobreath.com/perceiving-the-dynamic-sacrum/ "Perceiving the dynamic sacrum").

## In this week&#8217;s class we are continuing with creating a yummy embrace as we incorporate and explore the many movements we discovered in the ocho cortado.

**In [TangoBreath](http://tangobreath.com/tangobreath/ "TangoBreath, the practice of Argentine tango movement")** we will continue our work from previous classes with adornos by adding a few more.  These movements are becoming more important as we continue to explore their effect within the embrace in TangoLab.

**In [TangoLab ](http://tangobreath.com/tangolab/ "Tangolab, Argentine tango class.")** we will begin, as always, with presence in the embrace and subtle core movement. This is the perfect way to start learning Argentine tango. We will continue working with variations in linear movement while we begin incorporating the many choices in direction when following a pivot.

Last week we completely dismantled the ocho cortado, this week we will continue to explore all of its parts and the mirrors and reversals of those parts. Including an examination of linear and circular crosses.

As always our class will incorporate changes in direction, and how our internal movement brings life to the embrace. Including how to find which foot your partner is on while creating the opportunity for adornos, and a dynamic, great feeling embrace.

This week&#8217;s orchestra is [Carlos Di Sarli](http://www.todotango.com/english/creadores/cdisarli.html "Carlos Di Sarli")**,** which will be quite refreshing after the last few weeks of [Biagi](http://www.todotango.com/english/creadores/rbiagi.asp "Rodolfo Biagi"). Di Sarli&#8217;s music makes it easy to hear the phrasing.  [Kiki and bouba,](http://www.muratandmichelle.com/LECTURE/LECTURE/Home.html "Murat's musicality lecture.") are now living at Homewood, so they will always be available to add a visual to what you are hearing and feeling in the music.

## Wednesday at [Homewood, 19 Zillicoa, Asheville, NC. Map.](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19+zillicoa+street+asheville+nc&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x88598b51baff27bd:0x6de4259c7666e42e,19+Zillicoa+St,+Asheville,+NC+28801&gl=us&ei=WgDyTvXJB8Sltwf6s6zPBg&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CCAQ8gEwAA)
