This session will focus on the social elements of tango through music&#8211; we&#8217;ll listen and dance to the rich music of golden age tango, becoming aware of the possibilities for expression/communication in the dance, as well as come to an understanding of how, through the music, one does not only dance with just one partner, but with every other dancer on the floor. We will also learn about the quirky elements in tango, such as the _cabeceo!_
