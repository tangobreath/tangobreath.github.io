# You Come. We tailor.

Due to the success and popularity of our highly-personalized classes, we are now changing our immersive beginning classes to advanced/intermediate courses, in which we decide what to teach after students arrive to class. This allows us to focus on the needs and desires of everyone who attends.

As always, every class will incorporate body and movement awareness exercises, sensitivity and connection in the embrace, and deep explorations of concepts within the dance.

<span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Followed later in the evening by a Practica</strong> <span style="color: #000000;">(a time to practice what you have learned, to try new things, to get and give feedback, and to dance in an informal setting). Visit the <a title="Monthly Practicas" href="http://tangobreath.com/monthly-practicas/" target="_blank">Practica page</a> for more information. </span></span>
