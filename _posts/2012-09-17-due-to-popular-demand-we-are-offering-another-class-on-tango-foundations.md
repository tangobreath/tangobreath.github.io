**Due to popular demand we are offering another class on tango foundations.**  
We are getting back on track after an incredibly difficult summer. Coming up is our second class in a month on tango foundations. Four hours of tango for absolute beginners and advanced dancers alike. It's a great combination and everyone gets something.Â
