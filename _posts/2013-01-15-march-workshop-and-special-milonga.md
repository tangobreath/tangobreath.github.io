## CLASSES

**Expansion and Contraction: ****The Dynamics of Breath Applied to Tango Movement. ** 1:30-3:00 PM

Through exploring and applying the dynamics of breath, we will develop stability, musicality, control, and release in our dance. Progressing from the qualities of individual movement to the dynamics of the embrace with simple vocabulary, this class will help you find both the power and relaxation you need to be expressive in the dance. This class is especially great for followers who are searching for their voice and leaders who feel constrained by limited vocabulary or feel stagnant in their dance. All-levels.

**Increasing your Spectrum: Combining Principles of Expansion and Contraction with Axis Play to Create an Even More Dynamic Embrace. ** 3:30-5:00 PM

This class will expand on the concepts explored in the first class, to incorporate even more variety and expression into your dance. Combining the principles of expansion and contraction with small amounts of axis play can increase your dynamic range of expression within the embrace. This class will focus on small movements that combine axis play with the expanding or contracting breath to create a dance that is more dynamic within the embrace yet subtle on the outside.
