# Begin your Argentine Tango Journey.

We have developed a **5-week beginners series **that focuses on body awareness, technique, and communication with your partner&#8211; a different (and we think the best) way to learn a dance that is unlike any other.

Our next series is

## Thursday, April 24 &#8211; Thursday, May 29

8:30 &#8211; 9:30 pm Beginners class

9:30 &#8211; 10:00 pm TangoBreath Vinyasa (optional, included for both class and practica participants)

8:30 &#8211; 10:30 pm Practica, open to all dancers (supervised by Larry)

**Location:** <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/CswUf" target="_blank">In His Steps Dance Studio, 159 Church Street</a>, Asheville, NC

Cost: $50 per person

Practica only: $5

In our beginning tango classes, we explore and practice basic tango movement technique and concepts. The series is designed to give students the tools to understand the connections among movement, the music, one&#8217;s partner, and the flow of the dance floor. By the end of the series, students will be able to comfortably approach and navigate the social dance floor.
