# Due to popular demand, Eric and Susannah are excited to announce another immersive foundations tango class!

### [<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12051" title="TangoAxis" src="http://tangobreath.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/TangoAxis-150x150.png" alt="Tango class axis" width="150" height="150" />](http://tangobreath.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/TangoAxis.png)This class will follow a different format from the last, with a stronger emphasis on connection and subtle movement, while diving deeper into visualizing proper posture and movement. We will be incorporating parts of our Tangobreath vinyasa in class to create awareness and Provide practice techniques that will go well beyond class time.

This 4-hour class continues our exploration of** essential technique** in Argentine tango to prepare you to attend milongas (social dances) and practicas in a much shorter time than a more traditional series. We will also be inviting experienced dancers in our community to participate, so that you will have the opportunity to work with individuals who can give you personalized and knowledgeable feedback during the class.
