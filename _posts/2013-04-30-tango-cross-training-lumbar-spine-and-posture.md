We have been talking a lot lately about our cross-training and body
conditioning efforts and how they impact our dance. This post is about
conditioning your body, in which we explore various posture or movement
issues and the exercises that will help correct them.


## sometimes our bodies actually inhibit our good posture

While we are always finding ways to correct our posture, many times a
day, everyday, we realize that sometimes our bodies actually inhibit our
good posture, because they are weak in some places, too tight in others,
and maybe even too flexible. Today we are going to look specifically
at the lumbar spine (that&#8217;s the low back), since it is often the
source of spinal postural problems and for many of us, pain.

So here is the region considered the lumbar spine, which naturally has
about a 30-35% angle extending from the sacrum:

The natural inward curvature of our low back is technically called
lordosis. Often, the lordosis is exaggerated, in which case, it is
referred to as hyperlordosis. Most lumbar spine problems come from
either a natural hyperlordosis, a deliberately exaggerated one, the
over correction of lordosis, and pelvic misalignment. We&#8217;ll look
at all of these more closely below.

Do you have any of the following problems?

## Posture: Lumbar hyperlordosis:

Women, generally, have a tendency to let their pelvis tilt anteriorly,
creating hyperlordosis, but men also possess this inclination. We see
exaggerated hyperlordosis  very commonly in Argentine tango followers,
as they seek the connection with their partner by displacing their
ribcage forward and sticking their bottoms out to maintain their
&#8220;axis.&#8221; Some followers even pursue and develop this look as
a stylistic element. However, creating an exaggerated curvature in the
spine is likely to create back, sacral, and knee problems, also reducing
our ability to maintain core strength over time.

Causes of hyperlordosis can vary, but common ones include weak abdominal muscles and tight hip flexors.

Cross-training for hyperlordosis:

You will need to assess your body for reasons you might have
hyperlordosis. Sometimes, all you need is to become aware of it, and
correct it by lengthening your spine and adjusting your sacrum.

If doing this feels strained, you can do abdominal crunches (but not
flat-back sit-ups, which can actually strengthen and tighten your hip
flexors, rather than your abdominals) and stretch your lower back. Cat-cow
stretches are good and relatively safe for stretching both your lower
back and your abdominals. On a daily basis, find moments to make sure
that you are toning your abdominals so you contain your organs (rather
than letting your tummy hang out), but be careful of over contracting
these. There is an important balance to finding stability and release,
as always.

Stretching your hamstrings and your hip flexors can also be beneficial if they seem tight.

## Posture: Flatback

Over correction or flat back:

Sometimes, we focus so much on having a straight spine, especially if
we are highly tense, we will unnaturally reduce the lordosis in our
lumbar spine. Since our spine sits at a slight angle on our sacrum,
over straightening our back can be just as damaging to our intervetebral
disks as lordosis.
