I'm sitting in my petite hotel room in Turin as I write this. Soon, I'm leaving on the train 
to visit a friend in Nimes. It has been an interesting week. I've been stuck in my motel, 
sick with a stomach virus, I've danced tango with friends I haven't seen in months, and I'm 
in Turin where I spent a fair amount of time with my ex-wife more than 5 years ago. I have memories
but they are all a bit vague. To me, it's obvious I'm a different person than the one I remember.

Just before Christmas, while I was in Brussels, I moved this website,
which was deleted last year, from wordpress to jekyll. In the process
I've been cleaning house. I still have a ways to go. Videos are not
working yet, and I still have some editing to do. The transfer is
not fully seamless and automatic. I decided to start with my 
[first post](http://tangobreath.com/the-space-between-us) and go chronologically
through each post.

## A window with a view of a harmonious past with a tumultuous end

These posts are an interesting window with a view of the harmonious life I had then, 
it's been more than 8 years now. 
Life was good. It was full, everything was harmonious and happy. Love, Work, and life
in general were all in balance. Our tango classes were popular and full. The tango community 
was growing. I was practicing yoga, mountain unicycling and hiking several times a week, and I was in
love. Life was full and positive.

It didn't last. The last posts here are from 2014, when day to day life
was taking more than it was giving. Rock bottom for me was 2 years ago,
Christmas Eve. 24-12-2016.  How I got there is not all that important. 
The past is past, learn what you can and keep moving forward. I embraced my
studies in french and went. That was 2 years ago.

As I rewatched _Hedy's_ video from my 
[first post. ](http://tangobreath.com/the-space-between-us) 
I was reminded about the things we accumulate in our being, our memories, our emotions, 
our learned reactions. This is the stuff that makes us who we are right now, in this moment.  

## An ill fitting suit, a polluted essence. 

I had exchanged my "good suit" for an ill fitting one. I had accumulated a pile of
negative things in my being, as _Hedy_ puts it in her 
video **The Power of Connection**, my essence had become polluted.
This new suit of mine was more like a straight jacket, my outlook was bleak.

I could still dance tango well, that was a different suit I used for
dancing. At least I had that. But my daily life essence was not healthy
at all. I would argue that even my tango suffered. 

## Embracing uncertainty

I'm doing well now, and I accept the uncertainty of my plans, I even embrace them.
As I write this, my plans are changing, given another day or two I'm sure they will change
again. But my direction is forward.

My life now is completely different and yet the same, I still hold the same values I always have,
I still unicycle, do yoga, hike, dance and create. 
If anything I am more inline with my core values than I have ever been in my adult life.

My past is past, but depending on how we look at it
the past and our perception or memory of it changes. It might seem a little 
[Orwellian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orwellian) to
rewrite the past a little, not to truly change history, but to change our point of view of
it so that we can let it bring us positive emotions and memories if the way we remember
our past is unhealthy for our well being.

I prefer to think of it in terms of quantum physics, I think
[Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle) would approve. 
Our memories are not exactly true anyway, they are only what we
now percieve of what we percieved in the first place. 
[Schrödinger's cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrödinger's_cat) is dead, err, maybe, it
depends on how you look at it.

What we remember and what we don't and how we remember it is always changing. 
We might as well see, remember and tell our story from a point of view that benefits us. 

I have no illusions that my life is as uncertain as it always was. 
I'm en voyage a majority of my time, I still teach and dance tango, I'm still a systems developer,
I'm a sculptor, and I'm always a student. Additionaly I now speak french, I've ridden my unicycle
and my fixed gear bicycle in Paris, Bruxelles, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Lyon and many other interesting places. 
Now I'm starting to learn other languages as I continue on this path that is taking me 
to places unknown. I accept that long term plans are an illusion to let us be more comfortable. 

## Use neuroscince to be happy.

There are a few basic things I think can help anyone rise from depression and 
to create a positive direction in day to day life. 8 years ago these practices 
were a natural part of my being and I'm happy to have them back. As always, these apply
to tango as much as everything else. 

There are a few things that [neuroscience has proven to actually work](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2015/09/make-you-happy-2/).

  * Be grateful and show it. Express your gratefulness to others anytime you feel it.
  * Name bad emotions and feelings no matter how small, call them out, recognize them. 
  * Make more decisions!  Don't let your decisions be made for you. Choose!
  * Touch people. physically, nicely, affectionately.  Tango is good for that.
  
  That might be all you really need, but I'm going to add a couple more.
  
  * Take more risks. This is what lucky people do, it's why they are lucky. Be lucky too.
  
  And here's another one that _Hedy_ talks about. It's also
  something that tango requires of us, without it tango would not be tango.
  
  * Be present! In the moment and with others.
  * meditate - it's how to learn to be present.
  
## Being Present can bring peace and joy. 
 
Yesterday I had a fantastic morning walk around Turin just because I was completely in the moment.
I didn't have a thought in my head. I have a lot of memories here. I glimpsed a few of them, 
but the present was where I stayed. It was as if I was dancing a tanda with everything around 
me as my partner. The light was fantastic, the sounds, the smells, the sights, the feeling of 
the cobblestones beneath my feet. It was a magnificent morning by the grace of being present.

I'm ready for the next steps. My next immediate step, well, it's a train ride through the 
[Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhône-Alpes) and
across the [Rhône](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhône) to [Nîmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nîmes),
another beautiful city that I already a know a little. I'm not quite certain what exactly
will happen after that. Although I have some ideas.

And now, because it's such a nice video, here is the TED talk about
relationships by **Hedy Schleifer, The Power of Connection.**  It was the
topic of my first post here on this website, [The space between
us](http://tangobreath.com/the-space-between-us) and I think it's appropriate
that it is a part of my first post on this new website as I refind the
peace I once had and take new directions in life, wearing my nicely fitted suit. 
One last thing, I am truly grateful for tango and the people that it has brought into my life. 
Thank you all.
