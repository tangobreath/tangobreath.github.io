For reasons beyond my control you may have noticed that this web site disappeared last year.


This is the beginning of my new, more personal, website for my tango classes and articles on tango technique and kinesiology.


I know that this site has been sorely missed by teachers and students alike.
In response to that I have brought over all of the old content that so
many people use on their path to learning tango.
I still have some work to do, but almost everything is as it should be.


Please follow along as I write new articles, and re-commence with new
energy in helping others on their path in Argentine tango.


Sincerely,


Eric
