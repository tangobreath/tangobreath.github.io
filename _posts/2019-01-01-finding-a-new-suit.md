I'm sitting in my petite hotel room in Turin as I write this. Soon, I'm leaving on the train 
to visit a friend in Nimes. It has been an interesting week.
I recently moved this website, which was deleted last year, from wordpress to jekyll. In the process
I've been cleaning house. I still have a ways to go. Videos are not working yet, and I have some 
editing to do.  I decided to start with my [first post](http://tangobreath.com/the-space-between-us) and go chronologically 
through each post.

## The equilibrium of the past

These posts are an interesting window into the life I had then, it's been more than 8 years now. 
Life was good. It was full, everything was in equilibrium, Love, Work, and life
in general. Our tango classes were popular and full. The tango community 
was growing. I was practicing yoga,
mountain unicycling and hiking several times a week, and I was in
love. Life was full and positive.

It didn't last. The last posts here are from 2014, when day to day life
was taking more than it was giving. Rock bottom for me was 2 years ago,
Christmas Eve. 24-12-2016.  How I got there is not all that important. 

As I rewatched _Hedy's_ video from my 
[first post. ](http://tangobreath.com/the-space-between-us) 
I was reminded about the things we accumulate in our being. This is the stuff
that makes us who we are right now, this moment.  

## An ill fitting suit

I had exchanged my "good suit" for an ill fitting one. I had accumulated a pile of
negative things in my being, my essence was polluted, as _Hedy_ puts it in her 
video **The Power of Connection**. 
This new suit of mine was more like a straight jacket.

I could still dance tango well, that was a different suit I used for
dancing. At least I had that. But my daily life essence was not healthy
at all. I would argue that even my tango suffered. 

## Embracing uncertainty

I'm doing well now, and I accept the uncertainty of my plans, I even embrace them.
My life is completely different. My past is past. And I have no illusions that
my life is as uncertain as it always was. I'm en voyage a majority of my time, I
now speak french, and I'm learning other languages as I continue on this path that
goes to places unknown. Long term plans are an illusion to make us more comfortable.



## Use neuroscince to be happy.

There are a few basic things I think can help anyone rise from depression and 
to create a positive direction in day to day life. 8 years ago these practices 
were a natural part of my being and I'm happy to have them back. As always, these apply
to tango as much as everything else. 

There are a few things that [neuroscience has proven to actually work](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2015/09/make-you-happy-2/).

  * Be grateful and show it. Express your gratefulness to others anytime you feel it.
  * Name bad emotions and feelings, Call them out, recognize them. 
  * Make more Decisions.  Don't let your decisions be made for you. Choose!
  * Touch people. physically, nicely, affectionately.  Tango is good for that.
  
  That might be all you really need, but I'm going to add a couple more.
  
  * Take more risks. This is what lucky people do, it's why they are lucky. Be lucky too.
  
  And here's another one that _Hedy_ also talks about. It's also
  something that tango requires of us, without it tango would not be tango.:
  
  * Be present! In the moment and with others.
  
  
## Being Present can bring peace and joy. 
 
 Yesterday I had a fantastic morning walking around Turin just because I was completely in the moment.
 I didn't have a thought in my head. I have a lot of memories here. I glimpsed a few of them, 
 but the present was where I stayed. 

And now, because it's such a nice video, here is the TED talk about
relationships by **Hedy Schleifer, The Power of Connection.**  It was the
topic of my first post here on this website, [The space between
us](http://tangobreath.com/the-space-between-us) and I think it's appropriate
that it is the topic of my first post on this new website as I refind the
peace I once had and take new directions in life. Thank you to tango
for being here for me once again.
