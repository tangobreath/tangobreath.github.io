## A Boleos Workshop and a Victorian-themed Milonga!

For this year&#8217;s workshop before the Victorian Ball, we decided to explore so many dancers&#8217; favorite theme: _Boleos! _ But this is from our perspective&#8211; so class will be filled with lots of juicy body movement explorations, partner connection exercises, and straightforward understandings of just how these things actually work (when they work well).  We hope you will join us!

~ Eric and Susannah Gebhart

## CLASSES

**The Truth About Boleos I: Finding and Using our &#8220;Edge&#8221; in a spiral. ** 1:00-2:30 PM

Through exploring and applying the dynamics of our internal spiral, we will learn how to find the space where balance, extension, and release intersect, giving rise to the potential of the boleo. Followers and leaders alike will find and play with the &#8220;edge&#8221; from which the boleo arises. Intermediate.

**The Truth About Boleos II: Crafting Boleos _for _the music&#8211; the Communication & the Expression. ** 3:00-4:30 PM

This class will expand on the concepts explored in the first class, to explore a range of expression in boleos. Using principles of the dynamic &#8220;edge&#8221;, we will examine the technique needed to communicate the quality of a boleo to our partner (both for leaders and followers). In the music, we will explore big & swoopy boleos, tight & quick boleos, and low and high boleos.
