As a continuation of last week&#8217;s challenge,
<a title="Creating stability in our pelvis"
href="http://tangobreath.com/creating-stability-in-our-pelvis/"
target="_blank">Finding stability in our pelvis</a>, in which we
perceived subtle engagement in the area between the sacrum and hip joint,
we are going to concentrate on releasing this same area. Balancing the
internal dynamic between engagement and release is important to achieve
our greatest flexibility, strength, and resiliency in our joints.

## An exercise to release our pelvic joints.

You might be interested in repeating the
<a title="Creating stability in our pelvis"
href="http://tangobreath.com/creating-stability-in-our-pelvis/"
target="_blank">exercise</a> that was introduced last week, to bring
your attention and awareness to the area between your sacrum and your
femoral trochanter and hip joint.

Standing on both legs, relax your pelvic area entirely, though not
so much you fall down! Imagine water or air flowing through your hip
joints. Now, transfer your weight entirely to one leg, and allow the
hip to pop out all the way to that side. Allow your free hip to sink
toward the ground. Bending your free knee (since your leg will be longer
than the space between your hip and the floor), allow your free hip to
suspend there.  The key is to not force it down, but to let it fall
with its own weight.  Feel its heaviness.

Now, using the same engagement that we created between our sacrum and
hip socket in the previous week&#8217;s exercise, bring your standing
hip back into alignment, imagining it drawing and sliding back into
place. Let your free hip remain relaxed and heavy. You might bring your
attention to the placement of weight on your standing foot. What happens
as you bring your hip back into alignment?

## Creating fluid movement from our sacrum, through our free hip, into our leg.

Making sure that your standing leg is softly engaged (try not to lock
your knees) and leaving your free hip and leg relaxed and suspended,
start to create movement back and forth with your sacrum and let your
leg follow. Can you feel that the movement in your hip and leg originates
with sacral movement?

If you perceive that you are still moving your legs with your leg
and hip muscles, think about your hip and legs as water pouring out
of a hole in the bottom of a bucket that is attached to the front of
your sacrum. As the bucket tilts slightly forward, the stream of water
flows, and might splash a bit, to the back; as the bucket tilts back,
the stream of water flows to the front. Alternately, try imagining your
legs as slinkies that are attached at your sacrum.

You can also do this exercise standing on a stair or a yoga block,
letting your leg suspend over the edge, truly allowing your free leg
and hip to relax with gravity and respond to the movement in your pelvis.

## The challenge: bringing awareness of our dynamic pelvis to our habitual movements.

After you find the balance of engaging and releasing the area between your
hip joint and sacrum, try drawing attention to how this can influence
the way you walk and stand. Make changes of weight, and even changes of
direction quickly, tuning into your pelvis&#8217;s ability to respond
by engaging **and** relaxing when and where it needs to.

The important thing to keep in mind is that we never want to force
engagement, or even relaxation, meaning we do not need to over-contract
or over-extend our muscles. This happens frequently when we think too
hard about something, compartmentalizing muscles and forgetting the
whole system, or when we get nervous.

When dancing, when we feel off balance, many times we contract our muscles
out of fear, trying to get our balance back, but it ends up having an
opposite effect, making our bodies stiff and unresilient. By training our
bodies to respond intuitively to motion and learning to relax into it,
we can dynamically respond and resolve the movement in our bodies with
less tension and greater connectivity to our body system, the ground,
and our partner.
