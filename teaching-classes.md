# How I teach

As a teacher I believe that it is very important to choose our words wisely as
they can have a profound effect upon our students. My methodology relies heavily
on somatic techniques along with visual and kinesthetic mental imagery to guide 
my students to self discovery of tango alignment and movement.

Tango alignment and movement is, at its foundation, very simple.
There are only a few directions to move, the obvious are, forward, back 
and side, and in a linear or circular fashion.
There are a set principles which underly those movements
which allow for communication and exchange of movement within the embrace
with our partner. These principles open pandoras box to reveal that 
there are many other movements available, but all of them are easily
derived from the fundamental principles of movement. The key is to
be attentive, in order to sense the connection through us and between
use so that we may understand the initiation of movement and follow it
where it goes.

It is very important for students to develop their body awareness.

In my classes *Breath* is used to connect mind and body, induce a
relaxed and attentive state where movement is done with attention. It
is also a source of *initiation*. This then leads to *sensing* the
environment around us, to be fully present in the moment and brings
attention to our exteroceptive systems, vision, hearing, touch, taste
and smell. *Connection* is the sense of our connection to the floor and
our partner, but also the connection of those forces within our bodies,
and our ability to resist, yield and amplify the energy moving through
us. *Initiation* is the ability to focus on the source of a movement
and how that movement progresses through the body.

All of this to say, that I teach tango with a variety of techniques to
increase student awareness of themselves, how movement begins and moves
through them, as well as sensing everything around them.
We dance in the present moment, we must practice there also.

The goals are to understand how movement initiates and moves through our
bodies through the embrace and through our partners. Sensing how movement
flows through ourselves and our partners enables a point of view where we
can see that tango is an exchange of energy which flows through both dancers
as a flow of movement.

If done properly our energy and movement enables communication in the embrace 
in such a way that after some practice, we can forget about the how and simply 
use it to express ourselves in the dance, to the music, with our partners.

Following these ideas, I combine somatic exercises and imagery to guide my
students to their personal awareness of tango alignment and movement. 
It is very important that students learn the principles and concepts at
the foundation of tango movement by discovering how it feels and works
within their perception of their bodies. I do not teach steps, I teach
how to move, how to sense, and how to efficiently manage and shape the 
movement of the dance as it moves through their bodies.

With the development of the students awareness of their  proprioception
also comes an ability to distill the gross movements of tango into their energetic
forms which are the initiators for movement. These distilled movements are 
frequently imperceptable to the eye, but bring with them a great amount of
force which can be modulated to initiate tango movement in the embrace with
a partner.

Over a short time I reveal the entire envelope of tango movement through
a process which alternates between somatic exercises and visualisations
to entice healthy and fully aware tango movement which we practice continually
with breath, in a vinyasa.

The biggest challenge to learning tango is not tango. It is the 
unhealthy posture and movement we have practiced every day of our lives.
To overcome that we must learn to practice tango every moment of every day
of our lives.

# Classes

## The Foundation

My initial class is always a vinyasa of individual movement. 
This is a class which uses breath and mental imagery to bring 
focus and awareness. It feels in many ways like a class of Tai Chi. 
It is not like a typical dance class. It is very much centered
on awareness with slow intentional movement. If you have ever practiced
yoga or a meditative martial art, this class may seem similar,
and like those practices, this practice may also build a substantial
amount of chi energy in the room.

The basic class covers the entire envelope of tango movement in
one hour. Over time, as students improve, more concepts and their
corresponding movements are incoporated. After some experience is
built the classes will change in various ways to introduce more difficult
combinations of movement.

The goals of this class are: 
 * Understand the fundamental principles and concepts of tango movement, 
 become aware of how they feel in your body.
 * Learn how to practice the entire envelope of tango movement
 * Learn the entire envelope of tango movement such that moving 
 in these ways no longer requires thought. 

This is a demanding class for advanced dancers and beginners alike,
but it a class you will appreciate. Everything I teach is based on the
principles and concepts you will learn and master in this class.

## Level 2

This class is a partner class which always begins simply, very much like
the vinyasa, with a focus on breath and awareness within the embrace. The
class begins and ends with exercises which connect and develop our sense
of awareness and movement with our partners using the same imagery,
and movements practiced individually in the vinyasa. These exercises
build slowly into taking steps and creating more complex movement as the
class progresses. The emphasis is on awareness and intentional movement,
which leads to the discovery of how we interact in the dance and how
the forces of movement flow between us.

The goals of this class are: 
 * Learn to be aware of your partner, to sense their axis and the directions of
 their movement and potential movement.
 * Sense how initiating potential movement flows through your body and through your partner's. 
 * Learn how to create and destroy energy (potential movement) with your partner.
 * See a movement as a creation and release of energy which flows through us as
 movement.
 * Learn to receive, reshape and resend movement through the embrace with your partner.
 * Learn the principles of creating tango movements which create the dance.

For those accustomed to a usual tango class description, I would say
that these classes teach all of the usual named movements you would expect.
They sometimes have catchy names as you would expect for a weekend of
classes.

## Musicality

These classes also begin slowly, usually with a stronger theme of how 
a movement feels. In other words musicality. While the other classes will
always have some techniques of musicality, these classes generally focus
on one or two songs which have a certain feeling to them. We explore 
the various ways of expressing that music within our movement. This is 
where we can grow into our personal dance through an exploration of musical
ideas and expression. It's not the step, It's how you step. When and how 
you leave, and when and how you arrive.

## Tango from scratch series - All levels

I sometimes teach a series of classes from scratch. Some people might 
call this a beginners series. But even advanced dancers enjoy them
and traditionally I have always let my students come for free after
the second time through.

This class consists of a one hour vinyasa followed by a one to one
and half hour partner class. By the end of 6 to 8 classes all the usual
named tango movements have been covered in various ways, including 
sacadas and how to find them. At this point everyone is a beginner,
but capable of dancing tango.

In this format the first two vinyasa classes move more slowly and
together form what would normally be a single vinyasa class.

# What to expect

For the vinyasa I like for my students to wear socks, ballet shoes, 
or something very thin which allows you to feel the floor. The vinyasa
is very demanding when wearing high heels, and for men, the tango 
shoes can reduce the sensation of the floor significantly.

That said, I have done it in heels as have many of my students.
I don't recommend it until you are content with your ability to
do the vinyasa in socks.

I teach with patience. I hope you will learn with patience. Each 
class will awaken more self awareness and understanding. My wish
is to coax you on to the path of understanding through self discovery
rather than tell you to do something just like this! If you come to
an understanding of the principles and concepts of how to move, and
you know what they feel like for you, then there is nothing you can't
do. 

All that said, It usually doesn't take all that long to get a
reasonable foundation started.

If you have a problem, I will likely ask you things which will help
you explore that problem and find an answer rather than telling you
what I think it might be. This will help to develop your sense of 
proprioception which will be a necessary tool for your future growth.

## Beginners

I won't lie. This is work. But it's just work, and you'll probably
enjoy it. With each class you will improve, and that is very satisfying.
In a few months you will understand that tango is a journey, but you 
will be off to a good start. You will have good understanding of the principles
and concepts which underly tango alignment, movement and communication 
and will have ability to think critically about the dance, what you see 
in the dance, and what you might be taught about the dance. In other words 
you will be well equiped to forge ahead on your journey with tango.


## Experienced cross-over dancers

If you are new to tango, but not to dance, The most difficult challenge might 
be breaking old habits. If you come from some formal background of ballet or 
modern dance you will likely feel very comfortable with my teaching.

## Experienced tango dancers

Depending on your posture and habits, these can be very difficult classes.
Or they can be very enjoyable. They will be difficult for everyone in
some way. And there will likely be a few things that will make you think.
It's best to approach these classes with a fresh open mind and intention.

## Teachers

For teachers there is a wealth of techniques here. The somatic exercises
combined with the mental imagery are great tools to convey posture and movement
to students without telling them what to do exactly with words which often
does not work. As teachers we should always be looking for another point of view,
another way to coax our students into tango dancers. My teaching is very
personal to me, so I am likely to have some thought or idea or way of saying
something that might surprise you. Ultimately, I think you will enjoy my 
classes, they are great practice and they can be a lot of fun. Maybe
you will decide to start a TangoBreath vinyasa class for your community.
