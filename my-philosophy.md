There are many styles of tango, and there are many styles of learning and teaching. At the foundation, all of it is the same.

I have not found a better description of the role of a dance teacher than this quote by Irene Dowd.

_"The work of a teacher is to give students the tools of knowledge and
skills to help themselves change their own patterns of movement. The good
teacher gives the student the ability to be self-responsible. Effective
teachers make themselves obsolete in the end."_
  
In my heart, I know, that by sharing my view of tango, that others will
benefit, regardless of their experience or style of tango. It is a point
of view that informs many views of tango.

We believe that to dance Argentine tango well, a dancer must have an open
and accepting mind, and an open heart. Until they have both, a dancer will 
always be limiting themselves in some way.

Tango is a simple dance. Mastering a few things in a person's mind, posture
and movement gives a tango dancer access to all that tango is. While
providing a lifetime of challenges and growth.

The path to the fundamentals of tango movement and dance is the same
regardless of a persons role in the dance. The roles of leader and
follower carry too much weight, there should instead only be tango dancer,
embodying both initiator and responder. Perhaps a Navigator and co-navigator,
to further establish what little difference there is between the two roles
which both wish to express the music with their partner.

Learning the fundamental movements of tango are akin to learning the
fundamental sounds of a spoken language, Once the sounds are learned,
it becomes possible to create syllables, which then create phrases. The
complexity of tango comes from the combinations of these fundamental
sounds and syllables which can create very complex movements.  All of
which are in actuality very simple.

The mind, musculoskeletal system, posture and movement are completely
intertwined to create a system which interacts with it's self. Movement
should not be isolated to a single part of the body, each part should
be considered a part of the whole.

# On learning Argentine tango

I believe that everything begins with a calm mind, good posture, subtle core movement,
subtle communication within the embrace and proper technique. I also
believe that the best way to learn is through exploration, discovery,
and understanding.

##  Argentine tango movement and concepts, not steps

Learning the concepts behind Argentine tango movement
allows for complete freedom and growth as an Argentine tango
dancer.  Understanding natural and healthy tango movement from the
inside out gives everyone a solid foundation from which to work as we
explore the dance within the embrace. To facilitate natural and healthy
tango movement I have developed the "TangoBreath vinyasa"
The TangoBreath vinyasa is a guided sequence of
postures and movement connected with breath. Practicing a 
vinyasa flow of tango movement has proven to improve
body awareness, posture and movement both within the
dance and in our day to day lives. 


## Accessible but challenging for all levels of dancers

In my classes, I start with meditation, posture and sensitivity exercises,
focusing on subtle core movement, communication and presence within
the embrace.  I then continue with exercises that slowly reveal more
complex movements and concepts by adding to the subtle movements of
the exercise. Beginners can continue working with what they understand,
and more advanced dancers can explore the more difficult movements and concepts.  All
dancers lead and follow, and beginners and advanced dancers intermingle,
providing an effective learning experience for everyone.
